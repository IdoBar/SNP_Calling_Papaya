  abstract = {Long-read sequencing enables variant detection in genomic regions that are considered difficult-to-map by short-read sequencing. To fully exploit the benefits of longer reads, here we present a deep learning method NanoCaller, which detects SNPs using long-range haplotype information, then phases long reads with called SNPs and calls indels with local realignment. Evaluation on 8 human genomes demonstrates that NanoCaller generally achieves better performance than competing approaches. We experimentally validate 41 novel variants in a widely used benchmarking genome, which could not be reliably detected previously. In summary, NanoCaller facilitates the discovery of novel variants in complex genomic regions from long-read sequencing.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Accurate variant detection in the coding regions of the human genome is a key requirement for molecular diagnostics of Mendelian disorders. Efficiency of variant discovery from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data depends on multiple factors, including reproducible coverage biases of NGS methods and the performance of read alignment and variant calling software. Although variant caller benchmarks are published constantly, no previous publications have leveraged the full extent of available gold standard whole-genome (WGS) and whole-exome (WES) sequencing datasets.                                         Results               In this work, we systematically evaluated the performance of 4 popular short read aligners (Bowtie2, BWA, Isaac, and Novoalign) and 9 novel and well-established variant calling and filtering methods (Clair3, DeepVariant, Octopus, GATK, FreeBayes, and Strelka2) using a set of 14 "gold standard" WES and WGS datasets available from Genome In A Bottle (GIAB) consortium. Additionally, we have indirectly evaluated each pipeline's performance using a set of 6 non-GIAB samples of African and Russian ethnicity. In our benchmark, Bowtie2 performed significantly worse than other aligners, suggesting it should not be used for medical variant calling. When other aligners were considered, the accuracy of variant discovery mostly depended on the variant caller and not the read aligner. Among the tested variant callers, DeepVariant consistently showed the best performance and the highest robustness. Other actively developed tools, such as Clair3, Octopus, and Strelka2, also performed well, although their efficiency had greater dependence on the quality and type of the input data. We have also compared the consistency of variant calls in GIAB and non-GIAB samples. With few important caveats, best-performing tools have shown little evidence of overfitting.                                         Conclusions               The results show surprisingly large differences in the performance of cutting-edge tools even in high confidence regions of the coding genome. This highlights the importance of regular benchmarking of quickly evolving tools and pipelines. We also discuss the need for a more diverse set of gold standard genomes that would include samples of African, Hispanic, or mixed ancestry. Additionally, there is also a need for better variant caller assessment in the repetitive regions of the coding genome.},

  abstract = {Nanopore sequence technology has demonstrated a longer read length and enabled to potentially address the limitations of short-read sequencing including long-range haplotype phasing and accurate variant calling. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of the performance of single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification and computing resource usage for the state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we introduce miniSNV, a lightweight SNV calling algorithm that simultaneously achieves high performance and yield. miniSNV utilizes known common variants in populations as variation backgrounds and leverages read pileup, read-based phasing, and consensus generation to identify and genotype SNVs for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads. Benchmarks on real and simulated ONT data under various error profiles demonstrate that miniSNV has superior sensitivity and comparable accuracy on SNV detection and runs faster with outstanding scalability and lower memory than most state-of-the-art variant callers. miniSNV is available from https://github.com/CuiMiao-HIT/miniSNV.},

In this study, we collected and harmonized Nanopore datasets of the seven healthy individuals in the GIAB project across three independent consortia. By leveraging these harmonized Nanopore data, we explore the benefits of using a hybrid DeepVariant model to jointly process Illumina and Nanopore data for germline variant detection. We show that a shallow hybrid long-short sequencing approach can match or surpass the germline variant detection accuracy of state-of-the-art single-technology methods, potentially reducing overall sequencing costs and enabling the detection of large germline structural variations. These findings hold great promise for molecular diagnostics in clinical settings, particularly for rare genetic disease screenings.},

  abstract = {Variant calling is fundamental in bacterial genomics, underpinning the identification of disease transmission clusters, the construction of phylogenetic trees, and antimicrobial resistance detection. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking of variant calling accuracy in bacterial genomes using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing data. We evaluated three ONT basecalling models and both simplex (single-strand) and duplex (dual-strand) read types across 14 diverse bacterial species. Our findings reveal that deep learning-based variant callers, particularly Clair3 and DeepVariant, significantly outperform traditional methods and even exceed the accuracy of Illumina sequencing, especially when applied to ONT's super-high accuracy model. ONT's superior performance is attributed to its ability to overcome Illumina's errors, which often arise from difficulties in aligning reads in repetitive and variant-dense genomic regions. Moreover, the use of high-performing variant callers with ONT's super-high accuracy data mitigates ONT's traditional errors in homopolymers. We also investigated the impact of read depth on variant calling, demonstrating that 10\texttimes{} depth of ONT super-accuracy data can achieve precision and recall comparable to, or better than, full-depth Illumina sequencing. These results underscore the potential of ONT sequencing, combined with advanced variant calling algorithms, to replace traditional short-read sequencing methods in bacterial genomics, particularly in resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {The goal of biomarker testing, in the field of personalized medicine, is to guide treatments to achieve the best possible results for each patient. The accurate and reliable identification of everyone's genome variants is essential for the success of clinical genomics, employing third-generation sequencing. Different variant calling techniques have been used and recommended by both Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Nanopore communities. A thorough examination of the variant callers might give critical guidance for third-generation sequencing-based clinical genomics. In this study, two reference genome sample datasets (NA12878) and (NA24385) and the set of high-confidence variant calls provided by the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) were used to allow the evaluation of the performance of six variant calling tools, including Human-SNP-wf, Clair3, Clair, NanoCaller, Longshot, and Medaka, as an integral step in the in-house variant detection workflow. Out of the six variant callers understudy, Clair3 and Human-SNP-wf that has Clair3 incorporated into it achieved the highest performance rates in comparison to the other variant callers. Evaluation of the results for the tool was expressed in terms of Precision, Recall, and F1-score using Hap.py tools for the comparison. In conclusion, our findings give important insights for identifying accurate variants from third-generation sequencing of personal genomes using different variant detection tools available for long-read sequencing.},
