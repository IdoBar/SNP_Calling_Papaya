  abstract = {Abstract                            Summary               Methylartist is a consolidated suite of tools for processing, visualizing and analysing nanopore-derived modified base calls. All detectable methylation types (e.g. 5mCpG, 5hmC, 6mA) are supported, enabling integrated study of base pairs when modified naturally or as part of an experimental protocol.                                         Availability and implementation               Methylartist is implemented in Python and is installable via PyPI and bioconda. Source code and test data are available at https://github.com/adamewing/methylartist.                                         Supplementary information               Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {A key benefit of long-read nanopore sequencing technology is the ability to detect modified DNA bases, such as 5-methylcytosine. The lack of R/Bioconductor tools for the effective visualization of nanopore methylation profiles between samples from different experimental groups led us to develop the               NanoMethViz               R package. Our software can handle methylation output generated from a range of different methylation callers and manages large datasets using a compressed data format. To fully explore the methylation patterns in a dataset,               NanoMethViz               allows plotting of data at various resolutions. At the sample-level, we use dimensionality reduction to look at the relationships between methylation profiles in an unsupervised way. We visualize methylation profiles of classes of features such as genes or CpG islands by scaling them to relative positions and aggregating their profiles. At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the               spaghetti plot               and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest. In summary, our software makes the handling of methylation signal more convenient, expands upon the visualization options for nanopore data and works seamlessly with existing methylation analysis tools available in the Bioconductor project. Our software is available at               https://bioconductor.org/packages/NanoMethViz               .},

  abstract = {Sequence alignment data is often ordered by coordinate (id of the reference sequence plus position on the sequence where the fragment was mapped) when stored in BAM files, as this simplifies the extraction of variants between the mapped data and the reference or of variants within the mapped data. In this order paired reads are usually separated in the file, which complicates some other applications like duplicate marking or conversion to the FastQ format which require to access the full information of the pairs.},
