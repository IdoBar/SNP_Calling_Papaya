  abstract = {Abstract           Background  Nanopore sequencing is a long-read sequencing technology that does not rely on a polymerase to generate sequence data. Sequencing library preparation methods used in nanopore sequencing rely on the addition of a motor protein bound to an adapter sequence, which is added either using ligation-based methods (ligation sequencing kit), or transposase-based methods (rapid sequencing kit). However, these methods have enzymatic steps that may be susceptible to motif bias, including the underrepresentation of adenine-thymine (AT) sequences due to ligation and biases from transposases. This study aimed to compare the recognition motif and relative interaction frequencies of these library preparation methods and assess their effects on relative sequencing coverage, microbiome, and methylation profiles. The impacts of DNA extraction kits and basecalling models on microbiome analysis were also investigated. Results  By using sequencing data generated by the ligation and rapid library kits, we identified the recognition motif (5'-TATGA-3') consistent with MuA transposase in the rapid kit and low frequencies of AT in the sequence terminus of the ligation kit. The rapid kit showed reduced yield in regions with 40--70\% guanine-cytosine (GC) contents, while the ligation kit showed relatively even coverage distribution in areas with various GC contents. Due to longer reads, ligation kits showed increased taxonomic classification efficiency compared to the rapid protocols. Microbial profiles at different taxonomic levels showed significant variations due to the library preparation method used. The ligation kit outperformed the rapid kit in subsequent bacterial DNA methylation statistics, although there were no significant differences. Conclusions   Our study indicated that careful and consistent library preparation method selection is essential for quantitative methods such as microbiome analysis due to the systematic bias induced by the enzymatic reactions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Long nanopore reads are advantageous in de novo genome assembly. However, nanopore reads usually have broad error distribution and high-error-rate subsequences. Existing error correction tools cannot correct nanopore reads efficiently and effectively. Most methods trim high-error-rate subsequences during error correction, which reduces both the length of the reads and contiguity of the final assembly. Here, we develop an error correction, and de novo assembly tool designed to overcome complex errors in nanopore reads. We propose an adaptive read selection and two-step progressive method to quickly correct nanopore reads to high accuracy. We introduce a two-stage assembler to utilize the full length of nanopore reads. Our tool achieves superior performance in both error correction and de novo assembling nanopore reads. It requires only 8122\,hours to assemble a 35X coverage human genome and achieves a 2.47-fold improvement in NG50. Furthermore, our assembly of the human WERI cell line shows an NG50 of 22 Mbp. The high-quality assembly of nanopore reads can significantly reduce false positives in structure variation detection.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Assembling high-quality microbial genomes using only cost-effective Nanopore long-read systems such as Flongle is important to accelerate research on the microbial genome and the most critical point for this is the polishing process. In this study, we performed an evaluation based on BUSCO and Prokka gene prediction in terms of microbial genome assembly for eight state-of-the-art Nanopore polishing tools and combinations available. In the evaluation of individual tools, Homopolish, PEPPER, and Medaka demonstrated better results than others. In combination polishing, the second round Homopolish, and the PEPPER \texttimes{} medaka combination also showed better results than others. However, individual tools and combinations have specific limitations on usage and results. Depending on the target organism and the purpose of the downstream research, it is confirmed that there remain some difficulties in perfectly replacing the hybrid polishing carried out by the addition of a short-read. Nevertheless, through continuous improvement of the protein pores, related base-calling algorithms, and polishing tools based on improved error models, a high-quality microbial genome can be achieved using only Nanopore reads without the production of additional short-read data. The polishing strategy proposed in this study is expected to provide useful information for assembling the microbial genome using only Nanopore reads depending on the target microorganism and the purpose of the research.},

  abstract = {The revolution of genome sequencing is continuing after the successful second-generation sequencing (SGS) technology. The third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology, led by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), is progressing rapidly, moving from a technology once only capable of providing data for small genome analysis, or for performing targeted screening, to one that promises high quality de novo assembly and structural variation detection for human-sized genomes. In 2014, the MinION, the first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, was released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MinION identifies DNA bases by measuring the changes in electrical conductivity generated as DNA strands pass through a biological pore. Its portability, affordability, and speed in data production makes it suitable for real-time applications, the release of the long read sequencer MinION has thus generated much excitement and interest in the genomics community. While de novo genome assemblies can be cheaply produced from SGS data, assembly continuity is often relatively poor, due to the limited ability of short reads to handle long repeats. Assembly quality can be greatly improved by using TGS long reads, since repetitive regions can be easily expanded into using longer sequencing lengths, despite having higher error rates at the base level. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at locations where rapid and reliable sequencing is needed, but where resources are limited.},

Evaluation on MinION sequencing data sets against short- and long-read mappers indicates that GraphMap increases mapping sensitivity by 10--80\% and maps {$>$}95\% of bases. GraphMap alignments enabled single-nucleotide variant calling on the human genome with increased sensitivity (15\%) over the next best mapper, precise detection of structural variants from length 100\,bp to 4\,kbp, and species and strain-specific identification of pathogens using MinION reads.

  abstract = {Abstract             DNA methylation plays an important role in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, ageing, and cancer development. The most important methylation in mammals is 5-methylcytosine mostly occurring in the context of CpG dinucleotides. Sequencing methods such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing successfully detect 5-methylcytosine DNA modifications. However, they suffer from the serious drawbacks of short read lengths and might introduce an amplification bias. Here we present Rockfish, a deep learning algorithm that significantly improves read-level 5-methylcytosine detection by using Nanopore sequencing. Rockfish is compared with other methods based on Nanopore sequencing on R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 datasets. There is an increase in the single-base accuracy and the F1 measure of up to 5 percentage points on R.9.4.1 datasets, and up to 0.82 percentage points on R10.4.1 datasets. Moreover, Rockfish shows a high correlation with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, requires lower read depth, and achieves higher confidence in biologically important regions such as CpG-rich promoters while being computationally efficient. Its superior performance in human and mouse samples highlights its versatility for studying 5-methylcytosine methylation across varied organisms and diseases. Finally, its adaptable architecture ensures compatibility with new versions of pores and chemistry as well as modification types.},

  abstract = {Abstract             By offering extremely long contiguous characterization of individual DNA molecules, rapidly emerging long-read sequencing strategies offer comprehensive insights into the organization of genetic information in genomes and metagenomes. However, successful long-read sequencing experiments demand high concentrations of highly purified DNA of high molecular weight (HMW), which limits the utility of established DNA extraction kits designed for short-read sequencing. The challenges associated with input DNA quality intensify further when working with complex environmental samples of low microbial biomass, which requires new protocols that are tailored to study metagenomes with long-read sequencing. Here, we use human tongue scrapings to benchmark six HMW DNA extraction strategies that are based on commercially available kits, phenol--chloroform (PC) extraction and agarose encasement followed by agarase digestion. A typical end goal of HMW DNA extractions is to obtain the longest possible reads during sequencing, which is often achieved by PC extractions, as demonstrated in sequencing of cultured cells. Yet our analyses that consider overall read-size distribution, assembly performance and the number of circularized elements found in sequencing results suggest that column-based kits with enzyme supplementation, rather than PC methods, may be more appropriate for long-read sequencing of metagenomes.},
