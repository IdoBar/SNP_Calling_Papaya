  {"id":"rudenUsingDrosophilaMelanogaster2012","abstract":"This paper describes a new program SnpSift for filtering differential DNA sequence variants between two or more experimental genomes after genotoxic chemical exposure. Here, we illustrate how SnpSift can be used to identify candidate phenotype-relevant variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms, multiple nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions (InDels) in mutant strains isolated from genome-wide chemical mutagenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. First, the genomes of two independently isolated mutant fly strains that are allelic for a novel recessive male-sterile locus generated by genotoxic chemical exposure were sequenced using the Illumina next-generation DNA sequencer to obtain 20- to 29-fold coverage of the euchromatic sequences. The sequencing reads were processed and variants were called using standard bioinformatic tools. Next, SnpEff was used to annotate all sequence variants and their potential mutational effects on associated genes. Then, SnpSift was used to filter and select differential variants that potentially disrupt a common gene in the two allelic mutant strains. The potential causative DNA lesions were partially validated by capillary sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA in the genetic interval as defined by meiotic mapping and deletions that remove defined regions of the chromosome. Of the five candidate genes located in the genetic interval, the Pka-like gene CG12069 was found to carry a separate pre-mature stop codon mutation in each of the two allelic mutants whereas the other four candidate genes within the interval have wild-type sequences. The Pka-like gene is therefore a strong candidate gene for the male-sterile locus. These results demonstrate that combining SnpEff and SnpSift can expedite the identification of candidate phenotype-causative mutations in chemically mutagenized Drosophila strains. This technique can also be used to characterize the variety of mutations generated by genotoxic chemicals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruden","given":"Douglas Mark"},{"family":"Cingolani","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Viral M."},{"family":"Coon","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tung"},{"family":"Land","given":"Susan J."},{"family":"Lu","given":"Xiangyi"}],"citation-key":"rudenUsingDrosophilaMelanogaster2012","container-title":"Toxicogenomics","container-title-short":"Drosophila melanogaster","DOI":"10.3389/fgene.2012.00035","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"35","source":"Frontiers","title":"Using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model for genotoxic chemical mutational studies with a new program, SnpSift","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2012.00035/full","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"vasimuddinEfficientArchitectureAwareAcceleration2019","abstract":"Innovations in Next-Generation Sequencing are enabling generation of DNA sequence data at ever faster rates and at very low cost. For example, the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer can generate 6 Terabases of data in less than two days, sequencing nearly 20 Billion short DNA fragments called reads at the low cost of $1000 per human genome. Large sequencing centers typically employ hundreds of such systems. Such highthroughput and low-cost generation of data underscores the need for commensurate acceleration in downstream computational analysis of the sequencing data. A fundamental step in downstream analysis is mapping of the reads to a long reference DNA sequence, such as a reference human genome. Sequence mapping is a compute-intensive step that accounts for more than 30% of the overall time of the GATK (Genome Analysis ToolKit) best practices workflow. BWA-MEM is one of the most widely used tools for sequence mapping and has tens of thousands of users. In this work, we focus on accelerating BWA-MEM through an efficient architecture aware implementation, while maintaining identical output. The volume of data requires distributed computing and is usually processed on clusters or cloud deployments with multicore processors usually being the platform of choice. Since the application can be easily parallelized across multiple sockets (even across distributed memory systems) by simply distributing the reads equally, we focus on performance improvements on a single socket multicore processor. BWA-MEM run time is dominated by three kernels, collectively responsible for more than 85% of the overall compute time. We improved the performance of the three kernels by 1) using techniques to improve cache reuse, 2) simplifying the algorithms, 3) replacing many small memory allocations with a few large contiguous ones to improve hardware prefetching of data, 4) software prefetching of data, and 5) utilization of SIMD wherever applicable and massive reorganization of the source code to enable these improvements. As a result, we achieved nearly 2x, 183x, and 8x speedups on the three kernels, respectively, resulting in up to 3.5x and 2.4x speedups on end-to-end compute time over the original BWA-MEM on single thread and single socket of Intel Xeon Skylake processor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported speedup over BWA-MEM (running on a single CPU) while using a single CPU or a single CPU-single GPGPU/FPGA combination.","author":[{"family":"Vasimuddin","given":"Md."},{"family":"Misra","given":"Sanchit"},{"family":"Li","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Aluru","given":"Srinivas"}],"citation-key":"vasimuddinEfficientArchitectureAwareAcceleration2019","container-title":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)","DOI":"10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00041","event-title":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)","ISSN":"1530-2075","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"page":"314-324","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Efficient Architecture-Aware Acceleration of BWA-MEM for Multicore Systems","type":"paper-conference"},
