  abstract = {MinION and GridION X5 from Oxford Nanopore Technologies are devices for real-time DNA and RNA sequencing. On the one hand, MinION is the only real-time, low cost and portable sequencing device and, thanks to its unique properties, is becoming more and more popular among biologists; on the other, GridION X5, mainly for its costs, is less widespread but highly suitable for researchers with large sequencing projects. Despite the fact that Oxford Nanopore Technologies' devices have been increasingly used in the last few years, there is a lack of high-performing and user-friendly tools to handle the data outputted by both MinION and GridION X5 platforms. Here we present NanoR, a cross-platform R package designed with the purpose to simplify and improve nanopore data visualization. Indeed, NanoR is built on few functions but overcomes the capabilities of existing tools to extract meaningful informations from MinION sequencing data; in addition, as exclusive features, NanoR can deal with GridION X5 sequencing outputs and allows comparison of both MinION and GridION X5 sequencing data in one command. NanoR is released as free package for R at https://github.com/davidebolo1993/NanoR.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Nanopore sequencing may be the next disruptive technology in genomics, owing to its ability to detect single DNA molecules without prior amplification, lack of reliance on expensive optical components, and the ability to sequence long fragments. The MinION™ from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialized and is now available to early-access users. The MinION™ is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer that permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. Currently, the research community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets.             Results: We introduce poretools, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION™ for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (an application of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools.             Availability and implementation: Poretools is an open-source software and is written in Python as both a suite of command line utilities and a Python application programming interface. Source code is freely available in Github at https://www.github.com/arq5x/poretools             Contact: ~n.j.loman@bham.ac.uk and aaronquinlan@gmail.com             Supplementary information: An IPython notebook demonstrating the functionality of poretools is in Github.
