  abstract = {Background The recent development of next-generation sequencing DNA marker technologies, such as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), generates thousands of informative single nucleotide polymorphism markers in almost any species, regardless of genomic resources. This enables poorly resourced or ``orphan'' crops/species access to high-density, high-throughput marker platforms which have revolutionised population genetics studies and plant breeding. DNA quality underpins success of GBS methods as the DNA must be amenable to restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. A barrier to implementing GBS technologies is access to inexpensive, high-throughput extraction methods that yield sequencing-quality genomic DNA (gDNA) from plants. Several high-throughput DNA extraction methods are available, but typically provide low yield or poor quality gDNA, or are costly (US\$6--\$9/sample) for consumables. Results We modified a non-organic solvent protocol to extract microgram quantities (1--13~{$\mu$}g) of sequencing-quality high molecular weight gDNA inexpensively in 96-well plates from either fresh, freeze-dried or silica gel-dried plant tissue. The protocol was effective for several easy and difficult-to-extract forage, crop, horticultural and common model species including Trifolium, Medicago, Lolium, Secale, Festuca, Malus, Oryza, and Arabidopsis. The extracted DNA was of high molecular weight and digested readily with restriction enzymes. Contrasting with other extraction protocols we assessed, Illumina-based sequencing of GBS libraries developed from this gDNA had very uniform high quality base-calls to the end of sequence reads. Furthermore, DNA extracted using this method has been sequenced successfully with the PacBio long-read platform. The protocol is scalable, readily automated without requirement for fume hoods, requires approximately three hours to process 192 samples (384--576 samples/day), and is inexpensive at US\$0.62/sample for consumables. Conclusions This versatile, scalable and simple protocol yields high molecular weight genomic DNA suitable for restriction enzyme digestion and next-generation sequencing applications including GBS and long-read sequencing platforms such as PacBio. The low cost, high-throughput, and extraction of high quality gDNA from a range of fresh and dried source plant material makes this method suitable for many sequencing and genotyping applications including large-scale sample screening underpinning breeding programmes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The increasing use of high-throughput sequencing platforms has made the isolation of pure, high molecular weight DNA a primary concern for studies of a diverse range of organisms. Purification of DNA remains a significant challenge in many tissue and sample types due to various organic and inorganic molecules that coprecipitate with nucleic acids. Molluscs, for example, contain high concentrations of polysaccharides which often coprecipitate with DNA and can inhibit downstream enzymatic reactions. We modified a low-salt CTAB (MoLSC) extraction protocol to accommodate contaminant-rich animal tissues and compared this method to a standard CTAB extraction protocol and two commercially available animal tissue DNA extraction kits using oyster adductor muscle. Comparisons of purity and molecular integrity showed that our in-house protocol yielded genomic DNA generally free of contaminants and shearing, whereas the traditional CTAB method and some of the commercial kits yielded DNA unsuitable for some applications of massively parallel sequencing. Our open-source MoLSC protocol provides a cost-effective, scalable, alternative DNA extraction method that can be easily optimized and adapted for sequencing applications in other contaminant-rich samples.},

  abstract = {AIMS: A method for the rapid extraction of fungal DNA from small quantities of tissue in a batch-processing format was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue ({$<$} 3.0 mg) was scraped from freshly-grown fungal isolates. The tissue was suspended in buffer AP1 and subjected to seven rounds of freeze/thaw using a crushed dry ice/ethanol bath and a boiling water bath. After a 30 min boiling step, the tissue was quickly ground against the wall of the microfuge tube using a sterile pipette tip. The Qiagen DNeasy Plant Tissue Kit protocol was then used to purify the DNA for PCR/sequencing applications. CONCLUSIONS: The method allowed batch DNA extraction from multiple fungal isolates using a simple yet rapid and reliable assay. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Use of this assay will allow researchers to obtain DNA from fungi quickly for use in molecular assays that previously required specialized instrumentation, was time-consuming or was not conducive to batch processing.},

To achieve a high-quality genome assembly, we used the combination of two sequencing platforms -- Oxford Nanopore Technologies (MinION system) with long noisy reads and Illumina (HiSeq 2500 instrument) with short accurate reads. Given the quality of DNA is crucial for Nanopore sequencing, we developed the protocol for extraction of pure high-molecular-weight DNA from fungi. Sequencing of DNA extracted using this protocol allowed us to obtain about 85x genome coverage with long (N50 = 29 kb) MinION reads and 30x coverage with 2 \texttimes{} 250 bp HiSeq reads. Several tools were developed for genome assembly; however, they provide different results depending on genome complexity, sequencing data volume, read length and quality. We benchmarked the most requested assemblers (Canu, Flye, Shasta, wtdbg2, and MaSuRCA), Nanopore polishers (Medaka and Racon), and Illumina polishers (Pilon and POLCA) on our sequencing data. The assembly performed with Canu and polished with Medaka and POLCA was considered the most full and accurate. After further elimination of redundant contigs using Purge Haplotigs, we achieved a high-quality genome of {$<$}italic{$>$}F. oxysporum{$<$}/italic{$>$} f. sp. {$<$}italic{$>$}lini{$<$}/italic{$>$} with a total length of 59 Mb, N50 of 3.3 Mb, and 99.5\% completeness according to BUSCO.

Research articles often cite a ``modified'' CTAB protocol without explicitly stating how the protocol had been altered, creating non-reproducible studies. Furthermore, the various modifications that have been applied to the CTAB protocol have not been rigorously reviewed and doing so could reveal optimization strategies across study systems. We surveyed the literature for modified CTAB protocols used for the isolation of plant DNA. We found that every stage of the CTAB protocol has been modified, and we summarized those modifications to provide recommendations for extraction optimization. Future genomic studies will rely on optimized CTAB protocols. Our review of the modifications that have been used, as well as the protocols we provide here, could better standardize DNA extractions, allowing for repeatable and transparent studies.},
